<p id="description">Pyramid Display is an open-source application that allows you to create the illusion of a hologram on any device using the Pepper's Ghost Effect. With Pyramid Display you can upload your own images and the app will create a structure on your screen that reflects the image to create the illusion of a hologram floating in the air. The app runs in the browser and is compatible with any device that has a screen and you can customize the size and shape of the structure to fit your needs.</p>

<h2>üß∞ Building the mirror</h2>
To make use of this project, you need a mirror that reflects the images created by the app. You can build this mirror yourself. Here's how you can build a mirror for the standard display method (called "Standard Method" in the app):
<ol>
<li>Get a transparent material. This can be a transparent plastic sheet or a glass pane. The material should be as transparent as possible, but also reflect some of the light.</li>
<li>Configure the settings so they match your needs. Important are the settings "Size of the polygon in the middle" and "Number of sides / images".</li>
<li>Click on the calculator icon in the bottom right of the screen. This will open a popup where you have to enter some more settings.</li>
<li>Click on the green button with the text "Generate image". This will download an image showing you the form the tiles of your mirror need to have.</li>
<li>Cut this form out of the material you chose for your mirror. You need as many tiles as you have set the number of sides/images.</li>
<li>Lay the tiles edge to edge, so they start forming a circle. The connect the edges using some tape. Then connect the outer two edges, so your mirror forms.</li>
</ol>

Here is an image of a mirror with 4 sides:<br />
